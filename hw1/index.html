    Task 1: Simple Triangle Rasterization
  </h2>
  <p>
I first created a bounding box of the input triangle by finding the minimum and maximum values of the x and y coordinates of the triangles vertices.	
After this, I determined the correct winding order of the input triangle give points A,B, and C by computing the cross product of C-A and B-A.
If this cross product had a negative z component, then I would swap the B and C vertices producting the correct winding order of vertices.
I then traverse the pixels in the bounding box, testing if pixels are within the input triangle through an inside function I created that uses 
dot products to determine if the given point is inside the triangle or not, if it was, the pixel would be filled in with the input color. 
This method of rasterization is no worse than one that only checks samples within the bounding box, because it is a method that only checks samples
 within the bounding box.

Here we have my robot doing some lovely ballerina moves. Accomplished by applying some rotation and translations to the left leg bits.

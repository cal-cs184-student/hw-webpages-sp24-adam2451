		<h1>Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h1>
		<p>De Casteljiau's algorithm allows us to evalutate Bezier curves. Given a set of control points, we linearly interpolate every consequtive pair by parameter t, which is the point on the curve we want to evaluate. This 
		results in another set of control points. We repeate this reursivley until only a single point remains. This point is the point on the Bezier curve given by parameter t.</p>

		<p>Insert Overview Here</p>
		<h1>Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h1>
		<p>De Casteljiau's algorithm allows us to evalutate Bezier curves. Given a set of control points, we linearly interpolate every consequtive pair by parameter t, which is the point on the curve we want to evaluate. This 
		results in another set of control points. We repeate this reursivley until only a single point remains. This point is the point on the Bezier curve given by parameter t.</p>

		<h1>Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h1>
		<p>The algorithm we devleloped in Part 1 is also easily extended to three dimensional Bezier surfaces. Surfaces must be evaluated by two parameters (u,v) instead of one (t). So first we evaluate many  bezier curves along the parameter u to evaluate a sort of plane. We then do a final evaluation of our algorithm along the v parameter, giving us a point on the surface of the object. </p>

		<h1>Part 3:  Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h1>
		<p>Here we use area-weighted vertex normals to implement Phong Shading. Given a vertex we wish to calculate the normal of in a halfedge mesh data structure, we first record our starting half edge. From there we traverse the vertices of the current face (call them A,B, and C) and calculate the surface normal by taking the cross product of the two vectors (B-A) and (C-A). We note that A is always the same in this calculation as it is the vertex we started on, while B and C change as we traverse the neighboring triangles. Once all the neighboring triangles normals have been calculated, we sum them together and then finally normalize to a unit vector, giving us the unit normal at our vertex. Below, the two pictures illustrate how much more smoothness this method produces in shading.</p>

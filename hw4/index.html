		<h1>Homework 4: Cloth Simulation </h1>
		<h2>Overview:</h2>
		<p>INSERT OVERVIEW HERE</p>

		<h2>Part 1: Masses And Springs</h2>
		<p>First we create the mesh associated with a piece of cloth. To do this, we first iterate through all points in the mesh, creating a matrix of boolean values that store if the visited point is pinned or not. 
		We then iterate through all the points again creating point masses at evenly spaced points along the mesh. Lastly, we iterate through all the points again, creating springs between a point mass and its neighbors, if a qualifying neighbor exists. 	
		The following are screen shots of such a mesh, with all constraints, without shearing constraints, and with only shearing constraints respectivley.</p>

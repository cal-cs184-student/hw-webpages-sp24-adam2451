		<h1>Homework 4: Cloth Simulation </h1>
		<h2>Overview:</h2>
		<p>INSERT OVERVIEW HERE</p>

		<h2>Part 1: Masses And Springs</h2>
		<p>First we create the mesh associated with a piece of cloth. This involved creating point masses on the cloths surface as well as springs connecting them, these will be used to help simulate the cloths movement.
		The following are screen shots of such a mesh, with all constraints, without shearing constraints, and with only shearing constraints respectivley.</p>
